      Apex lets you build, deploy, and manage AWS Lambda functions with ease. With Apex you can use
      languages that are not natively supported by AWS Lambda, such as Golang, through the use
      of a Node.js shim injected into the build. A variety of workflow related tooling is provided for
      testing functions, rolling back deploys, viewing metrics, tailing
      logs, hooking into the build system and more.
