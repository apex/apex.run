## Building

Make sure your apex/apex repo is up to date, as this is where the documentation comes from. Then run the following to update index.html:

```
$ make
```

If you're editing a lot:

```
$ watch make
```

Commit changes, after you make sure to preview the changes in your browser of course :):

```
$ make commit
```
